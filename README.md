# SelectKingdom
SelectKingdom it's based on the tutorials of Andr√© Cardoso (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyVUwlB_Hahir_VsKkGPIA).

It's a prototype based on the Select Kingdom menu of Super Mario Odyssey, where you can select the Kingdom in the bottom buttons, and the camera will follow your decision.

I'm currently working on it in order to improve the UI and visual effects.
